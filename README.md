Data Science Tutor using dolly-v2-3b 

dolly-v2-3b is a 2.8 billion parameter causal language model created by Databricks that is derived from EleutherAI's Pythia-2.8b and fine-tuned on a ~15K record instruction corpus generated by Databricks employees and released under a permissive license (CC-BY-SA)

## Summary

Databricks' dolly-v2-3b, an instruction-following large language model trained on the Databricks machine learning platform that is licensed for commercial use. Based on pythia-2.8b, Dolly is trained on ~15k instruction/response fine tuning records databricks-dolly-15k generated by Databricks employees in capability domains from the InstructGPT paper, including brainstorming, classification, closed QA, generation, information extraction, open QA and summarization. dolly-v2-3b is not a state-of-the-art model, but does exhibit surprisingly high quality instruction following behavior not characteristic of the foundation model on which it is based.

Dolly v2 is also available in these larger models sizes:

dolly-v2-12b, a 12 billion parameter based on pythia-12b
dolly-v2-7b, a 6.9 billion parameter based on pythia-6.9b
Please refer to the dolly GitHub repo for tips on running inference for various GPU configurations.
